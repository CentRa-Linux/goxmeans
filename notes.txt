kmeansbi

get number of rows (number of data points)
clusterAssessment a mX2 matrix
matrix with the means of the columns of the data points
centlist - a list with one centroid

for each datapoint:
	distance betweend point and centroid squared

while len(centlist) < number of centroids
	  set lowest SSE to infinity
	  range through the list of centroids
	  		for each centroid get all the datapoints in its cluster
			perform kmeans to bisect this cluster
			get the sum of squared errors for the bisected cluster
			get the SSE of the cluster if it had not been bisected
			if (the SSE of the bisected cluster plust the SSE of the unbisected cluster) < lowest SSE
			   best centroid to split is the current one
			   best new centroids is the centroid mean returned by kmeans
			   best SE is the matrix of SE returned by the bisection
			   lowest SSSE is ((the SSE of the bisected cluster plust the SSE of the unbisected cluster) 

	  best_SE matrix is
